How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff clearly showed which lines were different and compared them side-by-side so the differences were obvious.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It lets you see the evolution of the file and of the changes you've made to the file over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: Each commit represents a logical change in the code

Cons: User error might forget to commit, or not commit frequently enough
